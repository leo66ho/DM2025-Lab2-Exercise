Film Review  


General Antonio Luna, amongst the most brilliant former soldiers in History of the 
philippines, is followed as he continues to force his countrymen against past and present colonial 
masters, as well as rise above their own fury disputes, to meet the expectations of the Philippine 
Revolution. 
This actually took place in 1898, when Spanish colonial power of the Philippines has 
crumbled. The Filipinos are preparing to become a self-governing nation when American forces 
arrive, but there is division among the Filipino cabinet. Spain consented to The Treaty with 
America after defeating the Spanish-American War, which the Filipinos were unaware of. Spain, 
together with the Philippine archipelago, relinquishes its territories to America in exchange for 
$20 million. 
The Philippines&#x27; military leader, General Antonio Luna, believes that the Americans 
should be expelled and that the Philippines&#x27; revolution to establish an independent republic 
should continue. On the other side, some Cabinet members believe that making the Philippines 
an American protectorate will help the country prosper economically. 
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The incomparability of President Aguinaldo to patriotic Antonio Luna is demonstrated.</span> 
Also, without using somebody that is capable of accomplishing something, President Emilio&#x27;s 
feelings triumphed, and his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">jealously at being simply outclassed by Luna&#x27;s Plans to save our 
country will be a risk to his personal accomplishments</span>, similar with what he did to Andres 
Bonifacio. 
Within three days, Luna and the Bernal brothers had organized a group of 4,000 troops 
and declared his notorious &quot;Article One,&quot; which said that &quot;those who fail to obey his commands 
shall be executed even without privilege of a conviction in a court martial.&quot; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Filipinos, according</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
to Heneral Luna, lack profundity and insight. That&#x27;s why his intentions as a General fell 
through—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">no one, not even the President, could comprehend him</span>. 
Macario Sakay. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It underlines that the uprising was more than just banditry; it was a 
revolutionary</span>. Macario Sakay was a former Katipunan revolutionist. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">He was truly the 
Katipunan&#x27;s Dapitan chapter&#x27;s leader</span>. Even though their leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, had already 
surrendered to the Americans, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">he battled valiantly</span>. He was then apprehended, but later released. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Macario Sakay, on the other hand, was a fighter for liberty</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">He couldn&#x27;t stomach the prospect of 
the Philippines falling under foreign rule once more</span>. He believed that if he did nothing, 
everything they had battled for would have been for naught. 

The Tagalog Republic was acknowledged by the last revolutionary leaders battling for 
liberation in various parts of Luzon. They all pooled their resources in order to mount a powerful 
counter-offensive against by the Americans. They were successful for a time, but the Americans 
became aware of their operations. As part of their counter-offensive, the Americans gathered all 
of the revolutionists&#x27; supporters in one location. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The Tagalog Republic&#x27;s demise is genuinely 
repentant</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It&#x27;s deception or treachery at its finest</span>. The Revolutionaries were sold to the United 
states government by Mr. Gomez, a Filipino citizen.
