The Filipinos are preparing to become a self-governing nation when American forces \narrive, but there is division among the Filipino cabinet. Spain consented to The Treaty with \nAmerica after defeating the Spanish-American War, which the Filipinos were unaware of. Spain, \ntogether with the Philippine archipelago, relinquishes its territories to America in exchange for \n$20 million. \nThe Philippines' military leader, General Antonio Luna, believes that the Americans \nshould be expelled and that the Philippines' revolution to establish an independent republic \nshould continue. On the other side, some Cabinet members believe that making the Philippines \nan American protectorate will help the country prosper economically. \nThe incomparability of President Aguinaldo to patriotic Antonio Luna is demonstrated. \nAlso, without using somebody that is capable of accomplishing something, President Emilio's \nfeelings triumphed, and his jealously at being simply outclassed by Luna's Plans to save our \ncountry will be a risk to his personal accomplishments, similar with what he did to Andres \nBonifacio. \nWithin three days, Luna and the Bernal brothers had organized a group of 4,000 troops \nand declared his notorious \"Article One,\" which said that \"those who fail to obey his commands \nshall be executed even without privilege of a conviction in a court martial.\" Filipinos, according\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nto Heneral Luna, lack profundity and insight. That's why his intentions as a General fell \nthrough—no one, not even the President, could comprehend him. \nMacario Sakay. It underlines that the uprising was more than just banditry; it was a \nrevolutionary. Macario Sakay was a former Katipunan revolutionist. He was truly the \nKatipunan's Dapitan chapter's leader. Even though their leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, had already \nsurrendered to the Americans, he battled valiantly. He was then apprehended, but later released. \nMacario Sakay, on the other hand, was a fighter for liberty. He couldn't stomach the prospect of \nthe Philippines falling under foreign rule once more. He believed that if he did nothing, \neverything they had battled for would have been for naught. \n \nThe Tagalog Republic was acknowledged by the last revolutionary leaders battling for \nliberation in various parts of Luzon. They all pooled their resources in order to mount a powerful \ncounter-offensive against by the Americans. They were successful for a time, but the Americans \nbecame aware of their operations. As part of their counter-offensive, the Americans gathered all \nof the revolutionists' supporters in one location. The Tagalog Republic's demise is genuinely \nrepentant. It's deception or treachery at its finest. The Revolutionaries were sold to the United \nstates government by Mr. Gomez, a Filipino citizen.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_43641577"}
